# Spring Boot REST evaluation
For a school project it's nessesary to evaluate frameworks for REST calls.
I evaluated spring boot. This repository is not maintained so please do not use this for production.

## Dependencies
I used:
* JUnit
* Postgres
* Spring Boot

Before you can run this application it's required to install a postgres database and chance the config src/main/ressources/application_example.yml to src/main/ressources/application.yml with your credentials.
